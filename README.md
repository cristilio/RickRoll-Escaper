# RickRoll-Escaper
Literally a HTML file which says rick roll detected to the file your friend/whoever send you. So basically after you get rickrolled you can act like you didn't click on it by launching the .html file and if they are not a computer nerd they will probably fall for it. I'll update it and make the UI and stuff better pretty soon! (And yea I know you can totally make this by your own but yea.....idk why I made this)
